## Now It's Clear! Let me Explain What Happened

You're fetching videos from your YouTube channel, not **searching** for videos. This is VERY different and much cheaper!

### Let me break down your actions:

**What you did:**
1. First: Fetch **20 videos** from your channel
2. Then: Fetch **50 videos** from your channel  
3. Then: Fetch **100 videos** from your channel

**The API method you're using:**
- `channels.list()` to get your channel info = **1 unit**
- `search.list()` from your channel = **100 units each**
- OR `playlistItems.list()` if using uploads playlist = **1 unit per request**

***

## Here's The Problem: `search.list()` vs `playlistItems.list()`

### If You Used `search.list()`:

```
First request: Fetch 20 videos = 100 units
Second request: Fetch 50 videos = 100 units
Third request: Fetch 100 videos = 100 units
...continuing this pattern...
```

**If you made ~100 search requests total = 10,000 units exhausted ✓**

***

### If You Used `playlistItems.list()`:

```
First request: Fetch 20 videos = 1 unit
Second request: Fetch 50 videos = 1 unit
Third request: Fetch 100 videos = 1 unit
...would only cost ~100 units total
```

**This would NOT exhaust quota ✗**

***

## So The Question Is:

### Which method are you using in your Replit code?

**Option A - Using `search.list()`:**
```javascript
youtube.search.list({
  channelId: "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  part: "snippet",
  maxResults: 50,
  type: "video"
})
// This costs 100 units PER request ❌
```

**Option B - Using `playlistItems.list()` (Better):**
```javascript
youtube.playlistItems.list({
  playlistId: "UPLOADS_PLAYLIST_ID",
  part: "snippet",
  maxResults: 50
})
// This costs 1 unit per request ✓
```

**Option C - Using `videos.list()`:**
```javascript
youtube.videos.list({
  id: "VIDEO_ID_1,VIDEO_ID_2",
  part: "snippet",
  maxResults: 50
})
// This costs 1 unit per request ✓
```

***

## How 10,000 Units Got Exhausted

### Scenario 1: You were testing with `search.list()`

If you made requests like this multiple times while testing:

```
Request 1: search 20 videos = 100 units
Request 2: search 50 videos = 100 units
Request 3: search 100 videos = 100 units
Request 4: search 20 videos = 100 units (testing again)
Request 5: search 50 videos = 100 units (testing again)
...
Request 100: search videos = 100 units

Total: 100 requests × 100 units = 10,000 units ✓ EXHAUSTED
```

**This is very possible if you were testing repeatedly!**

***

### Scenario 2: Your app was auto-refreshing

If your app was calling the API automatically:
- Every time page loads
- Every 5 seconds or minute
- In a loop without stopping

Then 100 calls would happen very quickly = 10,000 units gone.

***

## Let me Ask You:

### Tell me exactly what you did:

1. **Which API method did you use?**
   - `search.list()` ?
   - `playlistItems.list()` ?
   - `videos.list()` ?
   - Something else?

2. **How many times did you make the request?**
   - Did you refresh the page multiple times?
   - Did you test it 10 times, 50 times, 100 times?
   - Did you have a loop that kept fetching?

3. **How often did you test?**
   - All at once?
   - Spread throughout the morning?

***

## The Math

**If you used `search.list()` and made ~100 requests total:**
- That perfectly explains 10,000 units exhausted ✓

**If you used `playlistItems.list()` and made requests:**
- Would only cost ~100-300 units max
- Wouldn't explain 10,000 units ✗

***

## Going Forward (When Quota Resets)

**Use this CORRECT method to fetch from your channel:**

```javascript
// Best option - get your uploads playlist
youtube.channels.list({
  forUsername: "YOUR_CHANNEL_USERNAME",
  part: "contentDetails"
})
// Gets your uploads playlist ID = 1 unit

// Then fetch videos from that playlist
youtube.playlistItems.list({
  playlistId: "UPLOADS_PLAYLIST_ID",
  part: "snippet",
  maxResults: 50
})
// Each request = 1 unit (not 100!)
```

**This way:**
- Fetching 20 videos = 1 unit
- Fetching 50 videos = 1 unit
- Fetching 100 videos = 1 unit
- **Total = ~10-20 units per day instead of 10,000!**
