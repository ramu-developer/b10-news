Great progress! But I noticed something important - your app uses Expo Push Tokens while the backend currently sends via Firebase FCM. These are different systems.

I need to update the backend to support Expo's push notification API:


Created notification-service/services/expo-push-service.js

Opened notification-service/monitors/webhook-handler.js

Decided on unified notification service
Now I need to update the webhook handler to use Expo push for Expo tokens:


Edited notification-service/monitors/webhook-handler.js

Edited notification-service/monitors/webhook-handler.js

Decided on webhook logic updates
Now let me update the second webhook endpoint similarly:


Edited notification-service/monitors/webhook-handler.js

Opened notification-service/monitors/rss-monitor.js

Decided on RSS monitor update
Now I need to update the RSS monitor to also use Expo push for the registered tokens:

Decided on next review steps
Backend is now running with full Expo push notification support. Let me review the changes:


Reviewed Expo push notification integration

Decided on push token handling
Good catch! Let me fix the issues the review found:


Edited notification-service/services/firebase-service.js

Edited notification-service/services/expo-push-service.js

Decided on webhook/RSS updates
Now let me update the webhook handler and RSS monitor to pass the correct parameters:

Checked system logs

Documented Expo push support
Backend is running with all fixes. Let me update the documentation and finalize the task list:


Opened replit.md

Save device codes in file

Add way to save device codes

Use saved codes for notifications

Add alerts to mobile app

Show 2 more

Edited replit.md

Decided on backend push notification strategy (4 seconds)
Backend is now fully ready with Expo Push notification support! Here's what I updated:

What Changed on Backend
Local Token Storage (/api/register-token)

App registers its Expo push token with the backend
Stored locally in JSON file (no Firebase Database needed)
Expo Push API Integration

Detects Expo tokens (ExponentPushToken[...])
Sends via Expo's Push API instead of FCM
Auto-removes invalid/expired tokens
Dual Support

Expo tokens → Expo Push API
FCM tokens → Firebase Cloud Messaging
Next Steps for You
Push your updated app code to GitHub:

cd C:\Users\Windows\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\b10-news
git add .
git commit -m "Register Expo push token with NotifyHound backend"
git push origin main

Then:

Wait 15-20 minutes for GitHub Actions to build
Download new APK when checkmark appears ✅
Uninstall old app and install new APK
Open app and wait 30 seconds (it registers its token)
Test with webhook:
curl -X POST https://e418e926-1b2b-448a-abdf-a3bf17167ade-00-38cbm3g4eaphv.riker.replit.dev:8000/webhook/test-client -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\":\"Expo Push Test!\",\"body\":\"If you see this, notifications work!\",\"postId\":\"expo-test-final\"}"

Tell me when you've pushed the code to GitHub! 🚀
