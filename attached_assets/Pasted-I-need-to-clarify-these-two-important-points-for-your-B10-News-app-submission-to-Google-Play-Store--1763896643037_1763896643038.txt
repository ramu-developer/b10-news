I need to clarify these two important points for your B10 News app submission to Google Play Store:

## SDK 34 (Target API Level) Requirement

**Current Status (as of November 2025):**
- **API 35 (Android 15)**: Required for new apps submitted after August 31, 2025
- **API 34 (Android 14)**: Minimum for existing apps that need updates
- **SDK 34 is NOT compulsory** - you need **SDK 35 or higher** for new submissions now

Since you're building a new app, Google requires you to target **API 35 (Android 15)** minimum. Using SDK 34 will likely result in a rejection with the message: "Target API level is below minimum required level."

**Action for your B10 News app:**
- Set `targetSdkVersion = 35` in your `build.gradle` file
- Test thoroughly on Android 15 devices/emulator
- Ensure all features work properly on the latest Android version

## Firebase Integration Requirement

**Firebase is NOT compulsory** for Play Store submission, but it's **highly recommended** and practically essential for:

| Firebase Feature | Why It Matters for Play Store |
|---|---|
| **Crashlytics** | Google strongly recommends crash reporting - helps detect issues before users report them |
| **Analytics** | Provides user behavior insights - useful for app improvement |
| **Pre-launch Reports** | Google Play Console uses crash data from similar apps to predict issues |
| **Performance Monitoring** | Helps identify app performance problems |
| **Remote Config** | Allows quick fixes without app updates |

**What's compulsory:**
- **Data Safety Form** (required) - You must accurately declare what data you collect
- **Privacy Policy** (required) - Must be a working, non-editable URL
- **Target API 35+** (required for new apps)

**Firebase is optional but:** If your app crashes frequently and you don't have Crashlytics integrated, Google may reject it or flag it as having "poor quality" during the Pre-launch Report phase.

**Recommendation for your B10 News app:**
✅ Integrate Firebase Crashlytics (free tier available)
✅ Set targetSdkVersion to 35
✅ Complete Data Safety Form accurately
✅ Ensure Privacy Policy is correct and working
